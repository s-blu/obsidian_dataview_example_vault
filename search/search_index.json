For adding a query to the vault, there are two things to do: First, add the query with fitting test data so it produces results and secondly, share the query so it'll become part of the example vault. Vault To Do Want to help, but don't have a cool query at hand? Have a look at the Vault To Do - there's always something to work on! :) Get a local copy \u00b6 First of all, you need to get yourself a local copy of the example vault. There are two ways of doing this. Get a local copy by downloading the vault. Follow the [[README#Usage]] explanation for that. Get a copy via GitHub - this is more technical, but makes it possible to update the vault to the newest state and makes sharing your contribution easier. Get the example vault via GitHub \u00b6 You'll need a GitHub Account to follow these steps. If you're not git-savvy, it's probably easier for you to use the GitHub Desktop application for the following steps. Create a fork and clone it of the example vault . Now you should have a local copy you can work with. Make your changes like described below! Add a query \u00b6 When you want to add a brand new query, please do the following: Check via search if there's maybe already a file with the same goal. Then it might be best to add your query as a Variant of this existing file. A Variant of a query does, in the end, produces the same or a very similar/enhanced result like the Basic query, but adds more convenient, better readability, better usability or similar. If you don't find anything, create a new file under folder \"20 Dataview Queries\" Give it a descriptive name that describes the general goal of your query. Read the existing titles to get an idea. Insert the provided dataview query template by hitting CTRL + T Follow the checklist of the template If necessary, add test data for your query. See Contribution#Add test data for details Done - good job! The second step is to share your contribution with us Integrating other community plugins \u00b6 This is a vault about dataview, but one of dataviews strength is it versatility and usability with other plugins. Still, we want to keep this vault as slim as possible, so if you want to add a query that requires an additional plugin, please do the following: 1. Install the additional plugin in your local copy 2. Write the queries and take screenshots of the results 3. Add these screenshots to your query file 4. Add a hint at the top of the query page that the installation of plugin XY is necessary to get these working The plugin files will be automatically ignored and not commited, so that the only plugin contained in the vault is dataview. Everyone who has interest in experience these queries can install the plugin for themselves. A good example for this are the chart pages: Plot a Category-Series DQL query Add test data \u00b6 Probably, your query will need some specific test data. You can either add new files or expand existing ones. Please keep these points in mind: Do not delete or change existing test data, even it if looks broken. It could be that a query page needs these broken data sets to showcase how to handle such edge cases Always add test data in a sub folder of 10 Example Data , i.e. 10 Example Data/recipes . You're free to create new ones for this. Please always add your test data in a sub folder, even if you use tags for querying. It provides a better overview and makes maintenance easier It's preferable if your test data is general enough so it can potentially extended for new queries, but using very case specific test data is alright, too. Please make sure your test data does not hurt anyone, doesn't contain personal data and is not illegal (i.e. Copyright infringement) Script to generate semi-random test data There is a python script around, that lets you generate test data with some random values based on one or more template files. Most of the data under 10 Example data/dailys and 10 Example Data/books were generated with it - maybe it's a good fit for you, too. More info on the script itself. Share your contribution \u00b6 You've added a new query or enhanced the vault in some other way. Thanks a lot! Now, onto sharing your contribution. When you used a downloaded local copy \u00b6 If you used a static copy of the vault, but still own a GitHub account, please proceed as follows: Go to issues in the dataview example vault repository Hit \"New Issue\" on the right Give the issue a name that reflect your changes, i.e. \"Add query about (title of query file)\" Be welcome to give us a bit context in the description, i.e. what the query does Attach all files you've created or changed to the issue Hit \"Submit new issue\" We'll review your changed files and integrate them into the dataview example vault if everything is alright If you can't share your contribution via GitHub , drop a message in the #dataview thread of the Obsidian Discord and somebody will take care of that for you. Mind though, it's easiest for the maintainers if you share your contribution via GitHub. When you've created a fork \u00b6 Push your changes to your fork . Now, your contribution is available online, but not in the original example vault yet! For that, you need to create a pull request against the original repository.

What is Dataview? Dataview is a very popular community plugin for Obsidian.md . It lets you query your data inside your vault and can help you in various, powerful ways. Its potential is almost unlimited due to dataviews support for javascript queries Who is the maintainer of this vault? I'm Sam, a regular Obsidian user. You'll sometimes catch me in the dataview thread of the Obsidian Discord. I hope I won't stay the only maintainer for long - this was AB1908 idea in the first place, anyway. Why does this vault exists? Discord is not the best place to store information for later access and while there exists an extensive Forum Thread for sharing Dataview queries, it is not super intuitive and user friendly to search in it. The idea is to instead leverage Obsidians immense strength in storing data, making it easily accessible and searchable. As a bonus, we can interconnect what belongs together so it's a breeze for you to find the dataview example you need - and you can try them out, right in place, tweak them to your liking to see what's happening and how things work. Why is this not part of the Obsidian Hub? While I'd be delighted to get a reference to this vault inside the hub somewhen, not integrating it right away as multiple reasons: - This vault contains a vast amount of useless example data and I don't think the Hub is the right place for such data - To my knowledge, Dataview Queries do not render on publish instances, so you'd need to download the vault anyway - Dataview shines when you tailor it to your needs. In order to do so, it's most helpful if you can play around data and queries, which is only possible in a local copy of the vault. - Right now, this vault is only a planned project without much value just yet. It should mature to something valuable before we put it somewhere I have a cool query. How do I add it? Nice!

What's a good topic for a Use Case? \u00b6 Like the name says, a Use Case should be about some specific scenario you could achieve with dataview, which requires (or can require) more than one dataview query. They should be overviews for a topic . Some examples: - A Daily/Weekly/Quarterly Note (Template) - A Music Album Overview page that provides information for songs, the album, the artist, ... - A persons page with information about his birthday, the last contact with them, their interests, their relationships with other people, ... - Overview about a TV series, it's prequels and sequels, how many episodes you watched, when the new series comes out, participating actors, director, world, ... Difference between a query page and a use case \u00b6 If you have trouble deciding if your contribution should be a query page under 20 Dataview Queries or rather a Use Case, try the following: Start with a Query Page like described here . Write your query name and description. Can you narrow down your contribution to one specific sentence? Then you should use a query page. Do you end up with a sentence like \"Should do this or that or this other thing and something else, but also different fancy things\", you probably about to describe a use case consisting of multiple, different query pages . As a rule of thumb: A use case describes a scenario, a broader field , probably is a complete note in a real vault. A query (page) has a very specific goal and achieves one specific thing that'll probably end up as a part of a page. Parts of a Use Case \u00b6 A Use Case should consist of a Use Case Page and one or more Example pages that show the use case \"in action\". A Use Case Page \u00b6 The Use Case Page should explain what the Use Case is about, what its goal is, for what you could use it. It should collect all the queries via links that can be used for this Use Case, maybe with a little explanation why this query is useful. One or multiple example pages \u00b6 To make it easier to understand the use case and to play around with it, a use case should provide at least one example page, where some of the collected queries are used. Feel free to generate test data for this like explained in Contribution#Add test data . Structure of a Use Case \u00b6 A Use Case should be created as a folder under 30 Dataview Resources/33 Use Cases . For Example: 30 Dataview Resources/ 33 Use Cases/ Enhance your daily note/ // <-- Use Case Folder Enhance your daily note.md // <-- Use Case Overview/Explanation Page Example1.md Example2.md If a Use Case, for whatever (good) reason does not have and will not have examples, skip the folder and place the Use Case Overview directly under 30 Dataview Resources/33 Use Cases : 30 Dataview Resources/ 33 Use Cases/ Basics of Dataview.md // <-- Use Case Overview/Explanation Page","title":"Use Cases"},{"location":"00%20Meta/Vault%20Infos/Use%20Cases/#use-cases","text":"In order to make the vault better navigable and give some more context to available queries as well as inspiration how these queries could be used, we want to introduce Use Cases .","title":"Use Cases"},{"location":"00%20Meta/Vault%20Infos/Use%20Cases/#whats-a-good-topic-for-a-use-case","text":"Like the name says, a Use Case should be about some specific scenario you could achieve with dataview, which requires (or can require) more than one dataview query.

LIST Variants \u00b6 List pages from a certain author \u00b6 LIST FROM WHERE author = \"Conrad C\" List pages and show a meta data field \u00b6 Only one additional information For lists, you can only add one additional output. For more, you need to use a table or create a custom output . LIST author FROM List meta data values instead of the pages \u00b6 i.e. list source links of your recipes: LIST WITHOUT ID source FROM \"10 Example Data/food\" WHERE source Group list elements \u00b6 New \"first level\" When grouping lists, your \"first level\" changes. Without grouping, the first level are the file links you get back from your FROM/WHERE statement, so they automatically get displayed if you give no additional information to the LIST command.

Tip - Using FLATTEN to Clean-up Input Data Its possible that individual daily notes will have some, but not all, of the three values above. In these cases sum(...) will return an error and the entire group will be omitted from results. Additionally, length(...) will count the rows even when no data is present. To sanitise the data before calculating the average, `FLATTEN` can be used to filter out any missing data and create new sanitised arrays to perform statistics on. This process could technically be done directly in the `TABLE` statement itself; however the query becomes much harder to read. The approach used here is: `FLATTEN list(filter(rows.wellbeing.mood, (x) => x)) as MoodValues` Which effectively reads (from the inside out), as: take all the (unsanitised) values collected for mood, filter them to only give values that 'exist', put them back into a new list, and name that list MoodValues.

Tip - Using FLATTEN to Clean-up Input Data Its possible that individual daily notes will have some, but not all, of the three values above. In these cases sum(...) will return an error and the entire group will be omitted from results. Additionally, length(...) will count the rows even when no data is present. To sanitise the data before calculating the average, `FLATTEN` can be used to filter out any missing data and create new sanitised arrays to perform statistics on. This process could technically be done directly in the `TABLE` statement itself; however the query becomes much harder to read. The approach used here is: `FLATTEN list(filter(rows.wellbeing.mood, (x) => x)) as MoodValues` Which effectively reads (from the inside out), as: take all the (unsanitised) values collected for mood, filter them to only give values that 'exist', put them back into a new list, and name that list MoodValues. The `TABLE` statement is then free to perform clean statistics on the new MoodValues list.

G becomes x inside the function. { \"Drama\":1, \"Crime\":2, \"Horror\": 3, \"Comedy\": 4, \"Thriller\": 5, \"Science-Fiction\": 6 } is an object that maps our genres to a numeric value that's in the end used to define the sorting. This is what puts \"Drama\" first and \"Crime\" second. By calling [x] at the very end, we \"search\" for the genre we pass into the lambda inside the function - returning its numeric value if available or nothing if we did not define it. In case of the latter, we'll get back 99 due to the default on top.","title":"If you have a lot of values to sort"},{"location":"20%20Dataview%20Queries/Sort%20a%20table%20with%20a%20custom%20sort%20order/#with-a-flattened-field","text":"TABLE WITHOUT ID key AS \"genre\", rows.file.link AS \"shows\" FROM \"10 Example Data/shows\" FLATTEN Genre as G GROUP BY G SORT default(((x) = { \"Drama\":1, \"Crime\":2, \"Horror\": 3, \"Comedy\": 4, \"Thriller\": 5, \"Science-Fiction\": 6 }[x])(G), \"99\") ASC","title":"With a flattened field"},{"location":"20%20Dataview%20Queries/Sort%20a%20table%20with%20a%20custom%20sort%20order/#with-no-flattened-field","text":"TABLE Show_status FROM \"10 Example Data/shows\" SORT default(((x) = { \"Running\":1, \"To Be Determined\": 2, \"Ended\": 3 }[x])(show_status), \"99\") ASC","title":"With no flattened field"},{"location":"20%20Dataview%20Queries/Use%20daily%20file%20names%20as%20real%20dates/","tags":["dv/list","dv/where","dv/flatten","dv/date","dv/regexreplace","dv/table"],"text":"Interpret a link to a daily note (in format YYYY-MM-DD) with a given time as a date Contributed by via Discord Use daily file names as real dates \u00b6 Basic \u00b6 due:: 2022-01-26 LIST due.day WHERE due Variants \u00b6 Take a time into account \u00b6 dueWithTime:: 2022-01-28 10:50 LIST dueDate WHERE dueWithTime FLATTEN date(regexreplace(dueWithTime, \"\\[\\[(.+?)\\]\\] (.+)\", \"$1T$2\")) AS dueDate Ignore trailing text \u00b6 dueWithTrailingText:: 2022-01-30 need to hand in assignment LIST dueDate WHERE dueWithTrailingText FLATTEN date(regexreplace(dueWithTrailingText, \"\\[\\[(.+?)\\]\\].+\", \"$1\")) AS dueDate Ignore trailing text but keep time information \u00b6 dueWithTimeAndTrailingText:: 2022-01-30 09:00 need to hand in assignment LIST dueDate WHERE dueWithTimeAndTrailingText FLATTEN date(regexreplace(dueWithTimeAndTrailingText, \"\\[\\[(.+?)\\]\\] ?([0-9:]+).+\", \"$1T$2\")) AS dueDate Split date/time and trailing text into two separate informations \u00b6 TABLE dueDate, subject WHERE dueWithTimeAndTrailingText FLATTEN date(regexreplace(dueWithTimeAndTrailingText, \"\\[\\[(.+?)\\]\\] ?([0-9:]+).+\", \"$1T$2\")) AS dueDate FLATTEN regexreplace(dueWithTimeAndTrailingText, \"\\[\\[(.+?)\\]\\] ?([0-9:]+)?

We have some tips on how to find out what's going wrong. Query returns 0 results, but the data is there. \u00b6 There needs to be something in your query that filters out or hides your data. 1. Try to remove the FROM clause. \u00b6 First, remove your FROM statement altogether. Does the result you expect show up now (probably among others, not wanted)? Add every FROM expression back one by one. For example, you have FROM #dv AND \"20 Dataview Queries\" , first add only FROM #dv . Your result is still there? Try FROM #dv AND \"20 Dataview Queries\" - do your expected pages vanish? Then the FROM clause - maybe in combination with the WHERE clause - is causing trouble. So next... 2. Try to remove the WHERE clause. \u00b6 Secondly, remove your WHERE clause but keep your FROM statement. Are the results still gone? Then your FROM statement is erroneous. Try to find the erroneous part and have a look at your data why they might get filtered out by it. Your data is there, if you keep the FROM , but delete the WHERE ? Then your WHERE statement is acting up. Add every WHERE expression back one by one. For example you have WHERE file.name != this.file.name AND #tag1 AND someMetadata , then add first WHERE file.name != this.file.name . The data you're expecting still there? Try WHERE file.name != this.file.name AND #tag1 . Still there? No? The last added part of the WHERE clause ( AND #tag1 ) causes some trouble. 3. Print out the metadata of your page. \u00b6 You found the error, but don't understand why it causes problems? It might help if you print out your current page like dataview sees it, to understand the structure of available metadata. You can do that in different approaches: If you're writing a table-query, add the metadata you're using in your WHERE as a table column and see if the values match your expectation. To see the whole current page with all its properties and metadata , add LIST this WHERE file.name = this.file.name or, when using dataviewJS queries, try $= console.log(\"Current file:\", dv.current()) and open the developer console with CTRL SHIFT I . Query shows some kind of error \u00b6 Open up read and edit mode side by side These examples are observed best when you switch to \" Edit Mode \" and open up a second pane in read mode - otherwise you'll only see the error or the dataview query :) Read the error description carefully. There is a little arrow pointing at the erroneous place. For example: TABLE WHERE #dv/list The little arrow is pointing at the # - because WHERE cannot work with a plain tag. You need to tell WHERE what to do with this tag. TABLE WHERE contains(file.tags, \"#dv/list\" Here, we do not have a little arrow, but only a error message: Got the end of the input . This normally means that an input ended (because the query is over) without dataview expecting it. On the last line you'll find what the plugin would've expected instead of the end of the query. We are missing the closing ) TABLE WHERE contains(file.tags, \"#dv/calendar\") Solved! \ud83c\udf89 Another example : LIST sum FROM \"10 Example Data/dailys\" WHERE paid FLATTEN sum() as sum It tells us that our WHERE clause failed and shows us the first three errors why. Here, it's the same one three times. Let's read this message: No implementation of 'sum' found for arguments: It's rather technical. What it tries to tell you: \"I don't know what to do with these arguments: (none)\" - because you did not give any arguments inside the round brackets. Lets try this: LIST sum FROM \"10 Example Data/dailys\" WHERE paid FLATTEN sum(paid, paid) as sum Now our error message is a bit different and the first three aren't completely equal anymore. It now says \"I don't know what to do with two things that are null and null - or array and array - or string and string\" So the sum function doesn't know how to handle our input. How to solve this? First, head over to the official dataview documentation and read up how sum works : [!cite] ### `sum(array)` Sums all numeric values in the array ``` sum(list(1, 2, 3)) = 6 ``` We've learned two important things here: First, sum expects exactly one argument . Secondly, this argument needs to be an array . So in order to use sum, we need to provide it with one array: LIST sum FROM \"10 Example Data/dailys\" WHERE paid FLATTEN sum(paid) as sum Huh, that doesn't give us an error anymore, but an improvable output. You want to know how to get a real sum?

You can do that in different approaches: If you're writing a table-query, add the metadata you're using in your WHERE as a table column and see if the values match your expectation. To see the whole current page with all its properties and metadata , add LIST this WHERE file.name = this.file.name or, when using dataviewJS queries, try $= console.log(\"Current file:\", dv.current()) and open the developer console with CTRL SHIFT I .","title":"3.

There is a little arrow pointing at the erroneous place. For example: TABLE WHERE #dv/list The little arrow is pointing at the # - because WHERE cannot work with a plain tag. You need to tell WHERE what to do with this tag. TABLE WHERE contains(file.tags, \"#dv/list\" Here, we do not have a little arrow, but only a error message: Got the end of the input . This normally means that an input ended (because the query is over) without dataview expecting it. On the last line you'll find what the plugin would've expected instead of the end of the query. We are missing the closing ) TABLE WHERE contains(file.tags, \"#dv/calendar\") Solved! \ud83c\udf89 Another example : LIST sum FROM \"10 Example Data/dailys\" WHERE paid FLATTEN sum() as sum It tells us that our WHERE clause failed and shows us the first three errors why. Here, it's the same one three times. Let's read this message: No implementation of 'sum' found for arguments: It's rather technical. What it tries to tell you: \"I don't know what to do with these arguments: (none)\" - because you did not give any arguments inside the round brackets. Lets try this: LIST sum FROM \"10 Example Data/dailys\" WHERE paid FLATTEN sum(paid, paid) as sum Now our error message is a bit different and the first three aren't completely equal anymore. It now says \"I don't know what to do with two things that are null and null - or array and array - or string and string\" So the sum function doesn't know how to handle our input. How to solve this? First, head over to the official dataview documentation and read up how sum works : [!cite] ### `sum(array)` Sums all numeric values in the array ``` sum(list(1, 2, 3)) = 6 ``` We've learned two important things here: First, sum expects exactly one argument . Secondly, this argument needs to be an array . So in order to use sum, we need to provide it with one array: LIST sum FROM \"10 Example Data/dailys\" WHERE paid FLATTEN sum(paid) as sum Huh, that doesn't give us an error anymore, but an improvable output. You want to know how to get a real sum? Head over to \"When using expenses in form of 99 $\" .","title":"Query shows some kind of error"},{"location":"30%20Dataview%20Resources/33%20Use%20Cases/Learn%20the%20Basics/","text":"Learn the Basics \u00b6 This page shall guide you if you are a newcomer to the power of Dataview. Before you start out , make sure you made yourself familiar with the official Documentation . While the documentation is not the most intuitive guide, it's important to get a grasp of the general idea and functionality to enable you writing your own queries. There is some further reading you can dive into, but that's not necessary to get started. If you stumble across something, maybe the FAQ can help out. Understanding meta data on notes \u00b6 Before you can start querying data from your vault, you need meta data to query. While there is already some information available on your notes and tasks , to leverage the full power of dataview, you'll need to add your own meta data via the frontmatter or inline fields. Learn more about YAML Frontmatter on the official documentation of Obsidian and take a look on our Frontmatter Overview and how Multivalue YAML Frontmatter Field s work. Learn more about Inline fields in the dataview documentation and our [[Inline Field Overview]]. Understanding Query Types \u00b6 The type of a query determines the format of your final output. We put together some basic examples you can play around with: Basic List Queries Basic Table Queries [[Basic Task Queries]] [[Basic Calendar Queries]] Understanding Data Commands \u00b6 Beside the four types of a query, you can use data commands to filter and enhance your query. There are some specialties to be aware of to successfully use them. [[How FROM works]] [[How WHERE works]] [[How GROUP BY works]] [[How FLATTEN works]] [[How SORT works]] [[How LIMIT works]] Understanding Inline Queries \u00b6 Inline Queries are a special form of query.

JavaScript Queries are an advanced technique, enabling you to create basically anything if you have dataview, time and knowledge. JavaScript is a full-fledged programming language and learning it takes a huge commitment. Don't fret, though! The native dataview implementation is already immensely powerful and let you do a ton of complex querying right out of the box. You certainly do not need JavaScript to get started and you're probably fine for the rest of your journey without opening this pandora's box. If you really wish to get into dataviewjs , hop over to your favorite search engine, search for one of the various free basic courses in JavaScript, learn the basics, read the dataviewjs documentation and get a glimpse of a world full of anarchy.","title":"Learn the Basics"},{"location":"30%20Dataview%20Resources/33%20Use%20Cases/Learn%20the%20Basics/#learn-the-basics","text":"This page shall guide you if you are a newcomer to the power of Dataview.
